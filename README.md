<br>
This project is still a work in progress.
<br><br>

**Purpose:**<br>
This project is esentially a clone of Amazon.com.  The idea behind the project is to create a site where anyone can create an account, buy, and sell.  This is also very similar to Ebay.com, except without bidding and auctioning.

**Overview:**<br>
This project is a primarily back end centered application that uses a series of interconnected databases to maintain a series of users, sellers, and products.  To use this application, a user first needs to create a account.  From there the user can then browse sellers and products, and make purchases.  If the user wishes to sell a product, first the need to register a "seller" which will contain their products.  A user may register as many sellers as the wish, and each seller can contain as many products as the user wishes.
